## Datasets

For experiments in this study, we generated a new quartet dataset and regenerated species trees with substitution-unit branch lengths for previously published datasets from [Zhang et. al. (2018)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2129-y) and [Mai at al. (2017)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182238). We also analyzed the mammalian biological dataset from [Song et. al. (2012)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1211733109).

### Simulated datasets

**Quartet simulations**

This dataset has 6 model condition, each with 200 replicates, that vary in their level of ILS and rate heterogeneity multipliers.
- Raw dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJSfpRpw5x3Xg4O0d5R5Jbvzlmb7Mq1P/view?usp=sharing) and includes species trees, true gene trees and other SimPhy outputs.
- Species trees with SU branch lengths are available in this repository in [data/quartets](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/SU-branch-length/tree/main/data/quartets).
- Results and intermediate data generated for the experiments in this paper are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kLMGEvtB-kTtQ8aCh82i2RvnIEDWwQyk/view?usp=sharing).

**30-taxon MVRoot ILS simulations**

### Biological dataset
The preprocessed mammalian dataset (with gene trees with mismatching names removed) is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0lcoFFOYQf8SlZvQmlOSkFJaEE?resourcekey=0-ClOa-cr-C3TeBWQlQuxmZw) and includes an estimated ASTRAL species tree, gene trees and alignments. The files generated for our analysis is available at [results/mammalian-biological-analysis/](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/SU-branch-length/tree/main/results/mammalian-biological-analysis).
