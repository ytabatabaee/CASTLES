* [Simphy](https://github.com/adamallo/SimPhy) produces species trees with branch lengths in the unit of number of generations.
* The included binary Simphy file changes Simphy to output species tree with substitution-unit (SU) branch lengths.
* See `quartet_simulations.sh` for example simulations on 4 taxa.
